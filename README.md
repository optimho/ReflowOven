# ReflowOven
Temperature controller for a reflow oven
The code has been tested and a few alterations have been made.

* The oven auto function works now, so it will automatically follow a reflow curve that has been programmed in an array.
* PID temperature control has been establised
* fixed some of the display issues

+ Need to still add a menu structure to offer different reflow curves.
+ Try and optimise the PID settings - control overshoots at low temperatures and is better at higher temperature control
